# Welcome to my BCAOL project

## Project info
Student Side:

On login/signup, the student lands on their dashboard.

The dashboard displays their QR code (which encodes their name, ID, and email).

A real-time 'Attendance' section shows the list of dates and times they were marked present.

Teacher Side:

On login/signup, the teacher lands on a dashboard.

The dashboard has a QR code scanner using the device camera.

When a student shows their QR code to the teacher:

The scanner decodes the data (name, ID).

Automatically stores an attendance entry in Firestore under:

A 'teachers_attendance' collection for that teacher, storing student name, ID, and timestamp.

A 'students_attendance' collection under the student ID, storing timestamp and teacher ID.

This update reflects in real-time on the studentâ€™s dashboard in their attendance section.

Firebase Integration:

Use Firebase Firestore to store:

Users (students, teachers)

Attendance logs

Real-time updates using Firebase streams.


Deliverables:

Role-based login and routing.
